Offering the oceans of the United Nations a way to help islands which are suffering the threat of being underwater and the NOAA, Coral reef Conservation Program a way of giving virtual prosthetic surfaces that hover on the same 5G quantum maglev network an advanced cryocoolant powered LiDAR projection sensoring systems which are in direct communication with the NOAA and emergency response teams and local islands of severe and high/low pressure weather patterns forming. Then have the quantum maglev ability to divert weather patterns with ballistic proof, water proof, fire proof quantum maglev surfaces interconnected with a completely separate polarity to the planet's surface, but quantum locked into a suspended state with the flux-pinned areas of the interconnected quantum 5G network. The network which picks up high pressure weather patterns with be able to capture all the hot atmospheric expanded air convert it and transport the clean water which is collected from the interdependant network of maglev islands. These islands grow natural surrounding plants and trees which are native to the areas and in certain area are a refuge to recultivate a healthy species of diverse honeybees. The main goal of the inland structure is to maintain an interdependent quantum maglev (IQM) with rapid ionic confirmation of position within the constaint power of liquid nitrogen from the every cryocoolant connected device sending the same frequency of the encrypted blockchain through the superconductive materials at the same always on frequency which naturally emmits from a sub-zero temperature. in a 5G speed frequency. This high speed pulsation will give the California coast and the rest of the world a surface that will no longer have earthquakes, and because of the virtical flux-pinning or 5G quantum locked and blockchain encryption the changes are given to the NOAA in real time responses so the surfaces of islands will be able move in a passive horizontally flat parrallel stable response and allow water to pass through a mesh which will allow all surrounding civilians a way to be saved first before a Tsunami drags a loved one out to sea or a hurricane fling a person in the middle of the night who may not have a radio the ability to be safely transported without having to worry who may or may not evacuate themselves to safety.

				, along with the implementation and supplemental help of current oceanic

				area receives decomposition elements of slag materials which drop directly into wastewaters from sewage lines with
				a normal solid waste and evaporation containment area closed off and separated from the plasma gasification and other 
				violatile gas compression areas. The inter dependant and ballistic proofing areas which handle gas compression and filtration
				in a nanomesh cryocoolant chambers are  of single bubble sonoluminesnence and nanomesh extraction filters after
				the slag and other metals are not able to sustain the impact of the warming of the surrounding areas 
				due to either radiation or other occurances which may have destroyed an area of Gaia.
				<br/>
				 With sonoluminescence and containment areas which stablize the radiation of water to normal ranges the oceans
				which are being destroyed with no visible hope will now have an ability to passively subvert high concentration
				poluted areas and provide enough atmospheric water generation and within a stable environment that the planet
				will have a better future than what was previously thought. The ability to extract poisons via sonoluminescence 
				and cryocoolant/LN2/ and other stable argon noble gas nanomesh extraction of elements will be the new scientific
				frontier of saving the planet/Earth/Terra/Gaia/home. Without marine biologists and nuclear physists/electric/mechanical
				engineers working with designs which marine biologists and other biologists are able to help structure coral reef
				prosthetic areas which provide underwater pillars which help sustain the passive quantum sublevel below the sealine
				and which is quantum locked/flux-pinned to the quantum array of Atlantis structures guiding coral habitats away from
				known forming areas of previously updated by the NOAA of possible supercell weather of high pressure or low pressure
				volatility forming. The passive subsystem and quantum hovering interdependant maglev network above the sealines which 
				are made from the same ballistic proof materials are themselves hovering because away from any ships or boats unless the 
				quantum encrypted network engages in safe unified formation to areas leaving the sublevel sealine oceanic coral reef
				conservation program units to decompress to level non-volatile to waves forming. The passive structure and ability to 
				adjust the columns of the undresater Turtle atlantis structures will allow the coral reef to stay connected to the
				quantum network adjusted and repositioned in real time buy oceanic navigation weather NOAA radar and National 
				Emergency Broadcasting/ Weather services updated telemetry readings. The constant relay of the network of coral structures
				below the sealine will conform to governmental jurisdictions as seems resonable, but with in reasonble time allowed 
				to move structure out of the way of any seacraft to avoid being destroyed. The Turtle Atlantis Coral Reef Conservation
				Program initiative will try and be an arm of the NOAA to help cyanobacteria an area for plankton and others microbs
				naturally biodigest the methane rich dead zone areas of global warming and try to offer the fish and the areas of 
				governments a way of providing non-toxic and poluted fish back to their oceans and to their people over time.
				<br/>
				restructuring of the Terra will be impossible. The main thing is to 
				provide a safe environment for the life of the coral reefs of Gaia to sustain life instead of destroy it. The 
				people have multiplied enough and their technologies have advanced far enough that the habitation of Mars is the 
				only solution to some, but there are a few others which have stayed and see that there is still hope for humanity.
				The Galactic Federation of Light and Love along with all the former Atlanteans with the passing of Nibiru have given
				the human races an ability to now restructure all the planets into a better place to survive instead of being stuck 
				on the fringes of death in many ocean waters with no other hope except to allow another society/race/sex/nonbinary/who
				/that "seems" hateful/disgusted/or have some other emnity really only hate the cage in which their current societies
				make them suffer in order to monopolize off of wars/pharmaceuticals/real estate/insurance/ and the television mind control
				governments which constantly make people watch the news to stay with a narrative which makes since in some ways but
				not really at all because it has made people ill to even consider that there is any hope with what their governments 
				have made their very elect do upon the Terra, Earth or Gaia.
				<br/>
				<br>
				Thankfully, there is plenty the Mutual UFO Network have learned to stablize electromagnetic flux patterns and allow
				a quantum array to allow a stable platform on an encrypted blockchain network to allow people an alternative to having
				be in the same area of people or governments which spray chemicals and biological weapons of mass destruction upon 
				people in the world any more. The heavens will save people if the reguvination of our oceans happen with virtual
				 beach front homes which receive the tide of the ocean in a quantum maglev state hovering on the sealine. The beautiful
				thing about the carbon structure of graphene is the same structure in which a quantum array of aquaponic vivariums will
				be able to keep the sonoluminescence frequency to stablize the structure in the same quantum state on the sealine. The
				omnidirectional ability of an interdependent network will allow the surfaces of the Turtle Atlantis NOAA aquaponic coral 
				reef conservation program and plenty of other environment protection agencies/ united nations agencies/ and many others
				transportation to remote islands which can provide fish and a stable surface of to grow vivarium greenhouse structures

				helps islanders in surrounding areas provide areas of refuge until the restructuring of the islands branch out. Similar
				to Dubai but without the constant moving of sand into other areas of the ocean. The oceans have plenty of sand and limestone
				underneath without the need for filling up the oceans; diverting natural oceanic tides which have flowed in a pattern
				without our help for years and should for many more years to come. The Heavens and Quantum Maglev with the plasma
				gasification of diverse solid and municipal wastes into energy and housing structures which opperate on the same maglev

Because spending billions on talking about climate change to people has not only exhausted the amount of money that it would have taken to implement such a solution in the amount of time it has taken to reach the amount of people every year to bring awarness to these issues, but it has exhausted the attention of people who are tired of hearing about climate change without any better ideas other that getting rid of single use plastics and covering <a href="https://www.epa.gov/superfund/search-superfund-sites-where-you-live"> superfunds</a> with solar panels and wind turbines. Scientists have already proven that methane is the major contributor of greenhouse gases, and they have also let us know that the main source of this methane is emmited from the ocean which takes up a major part of the surface of our Gaia. If methane which has over 25 times greater impact on the Earth's global warmth it would automatically put the area of interest of people to not remain trashing a planet with garbage and flushing their sewage waste into the surrounding oceans, but it should behoove a race to see that the very problem that people are complaining about is not the cars they drive which feed the plant life on the surface. Rather it is the cyanobacteria that forms dead zones which kill sea life and fish all over our Gaia. Our oceans are like the lungs of our body if the lungs are poluted with toxins the rest of the body will suffer.

				' the source of all the warmth of the planet which they have also confirmed that if we don't save it now we will loose this planet. This area which is responsible for this warming is no other than the ocean. The expansion and the filling of the ocean so refine more of the cyanobacteria which is in the ocean will greatly help reduce the warming of the planet. If Turtle Atlantis is implemented and expands out into the ocean and starts to clean up the polutions and wastes which we pump into our oceans every day then we are doing nothing, but talking about climate change and not hitting on what it takes to create climate action. Action starts with an expansion into the ocean with virtual beach front housing with the ability to offer surrounding islands greater "common wealth". With a maglev system which transports clean Liquid Natural Gas (LNG) from the ocean floor and provides homes on islands with clean burning LNG we will also be able to provide nearly an unlimited supply until all the ocean floors are well managed. Then homes will be able to use Liquid Nitrogen as a superconductive energy source. Liquid Nitrogen causes a superconductive element to levitate and allows interdependant units which provide their own superconductive electomagnetic surface the ability to be quantum locked and allow ions to pass through when directed with a path with <a href="https://rosap.ntl.bts.gov/view/dot/44347/dot_44347_DS1.pdf">laser point accuracy</a> when given a projection of the ionic propulsion between two encrypted vertices on the same quantum network.

					<h2>How do I get started?</h2>
					<p>
						<br>
						The best way is to start at you home and think of it having a different roof with an independant suspended magnetic levitating (Maglev) interdependant network of vivariums which are easily transportable to a safe environment when needed with laser point optical LiDAR scannings of road vehicles, moisture in weather patterns updating the NOAA of possible storm dangers to the EBS and other Homeland Security safety/ cyber personel to help the DOE with networking the safe transit of children and families in rooms/bedrooms/or entire living facilities to safe locations during an immediate need for evacuations.
						with thermal interlacing and V-Ray tracing enhanced optical readouts similar to current windshield projection readouts that are commonly implemented currently with vehicles which display speedometer on the windshield to keep the driver from looking down constantly. for current Tesla vehicles and other EV on the market to ensure the safety of children while in non-maglev transit.<br>
						<br />
						<br>
						<br />
						Keeping buses above roads and collisions with trains, trees or other obsticles which have been proven track recorded history of tragedy will now allow bus drivers and insurance agencies rest assured that we will all be in good hands while in the heavens. A maglev society will keep your home as well as your precious people and belongings from being damaged, attacked or stolen.
						<br>
						This would be kind of hard to imagine with the amount of questions people already have concerning magnetic levitation being that it is a rare implementation that has been around since the late 1960's in Japan and only seen in America later on and now implemented as a hyperloop by Elon Musk. Quantum Maglev has more dynamic mobility as two interdependant superconductive materials can now send signals through to the other interconnected superconductive material on a encrypted network. Allowing maglev interconnections on a blockchain network which is powered by an even greater maglev network keeps the maglev connection is established with always on power of liquid nitrogen.
						<br>
						If you are now thinking that sounds way to technical for me to understand. Scientists are working every day to make it safer and more effecient, which is pretty hard. So far, maglev has reported 0 casualties when people remain inside a moving compartment (this happened at Disney World with a monorail type maglev system, and nobody talks about it anymore for obvious reasons). Also, superconductive energy is easier to shield from electromagnetic frequencies (or radioactive frequencies as with nuclear power) because simple thermal mylar or aluminum sheets block 98% of all EMFs (which is far more than certain companies offer from their cell towers of mass destruction).
						<br>
						This will allow anybody who has a liquid nitrogen generator and the dewars to contain the LN2 to create a superconductive area suspended and interconnected to any superconductive material which has the same LN2 or other low-temperature superconductive area, and keep it stationary in a flux pinned state. You can think of strength flux-pinning as the magnetic flux between a magnetic door at a convienance store. You may have seen people try to force a magnetic door like this open while it was locked. This same strength when sent at a rapid succesion. Most magnetic doors have electricity applied coming from somewhere inside the frame of the door connected to a power switch of some kind. Now imagine the same power of both the door and the frame, but now you can polorize the door and the frame magnetic signal, and if the signal was strong enough you could open and close the door with the flip of a switch. This would never happen to electic doors because of safty reasons, but if that same strength is applied to superconductive materials and allows the safe mobility of you home and all your belongings to a safer area (i.e. a hurricane) you could not have to worry about what the highways may be like if you had to move out of the way really quickly.
						<br>
						Even still, when applying the same maglev system to a quantum field every connected surface becomes even stronger because of the quantum magnetic flux happening at a greater scale.

Because spending billions on talking about climate change to people has not only exhausted the amount of money that it would have taken to implement such a solution in the amount of time it has taken to reach the amount of people every year to bring awarness to these issues, but it has exhausted the attention of people who are tired of hearing about climate change without any better ideas other that getting rid of single use plastics and covering <a href="https://www.epa.gov/superfund/search-superfund-sites-where-you-live"> superfunds</a> with solar panels and wind turbines. Scientists have already proven that methane is the major contributor of greenhouse gases, and they have also let us know that the main source of this methane is emmited from the ocean which takes up a major part of the surface of our Gaia. If methane which has over 25 times greater impact on the Earth's global warmth it would automatically put the area of interest of people to not remain trashing a planet with garbage and flushing their sewage waste into the surrounding oceans, but it should behoove a race to see that the very problem that people are complaining about is not the cars they drive which feed the plant life on the surface. Rather it is the cyanobacteria that forms dead zones which kill sea life and fish all over our Gaia. Our oceans are like the lungs of our body if the lungs are poluted with toxins the rest of the body will suffer.

This area which is responsible for this warming is no other than the ocean. The expansion and the filling of the ocean so refine more of the cyanobacteria which is in the ocean will greatly help reduce the warming of the planet. If Turtle Atlantis is implemented and expands out into the ocean and starts to clean up the polutions and wastes which we pump into our oceans every day then we are doing nothing, but talking about climate change and not hitting on what it takes to create climate action. Action starts with an expansion into the ocean with virtual beach front housing with the ability to offer surrounding islands greater "common wealth". With a maglev system which transports clean Liquid Natural Gas (LNG) from the ocean floor and provides homes on islands with clean burning LNG we will also be able to provide nearly an unlimited supply until all the ocean floors are well managed. Then homes will be able to use Liquid Nitrogen as a superconductive energy source. Liquid Nitrogen causes a superconductive element to levitate and allows interdependant units which provide their own superconductive electomagnetic surface the ability to be quantum locked and allow ions to pass through when directed with a path with <a href="https://rosap.ntl.bts.gov/view/dot/44347/dot_44347_DS1.pdf">laser point accuracy</a> when given a projection of the ionic propulsion between two encrypted vertices on the same quantum network.

	<h2>How do I get started?</h2>
	<p>
		<br>
		The best way is to start at you home and think of it having a different roof with an independant suspended magnetic levitating (Maglev) interdependant network of vivariums which are easily transportable to a safe environment when needed with laser point optical LiDAR scannings of road vehicles, moisture in weather patterns updating the NOAA of possible storm dangers to the EBS and other Homeland Security safety/ cyber personel to help the DOE with networking the safe transit of children and families in rooms/bedrooms/or entire living facilities to safe locations during an immediate need for evacuations.
		with thermal interlacing and V-Ray tracing enhanced optical readouts similar to current windshield projection readouts that are commonly implemented currently with vehicles which display speedometer on the windshield to keep the driver from looking down constantly. for current Tesla vehicles and other EV on the market to ensure the safety of children while in non-maglev transit.<br>
		<br />
		<br>
		<br />
		Keeping buses above roads and collisions with trains, trees or other obsticles which have been proven track recorded history of tragedy will now allow bus drivers and insurance agencies rest assured that we will all be in good hands while in the heavens. A maglev society will keep your home as well as your precious people and belongings from being damaged, attacked or stolen.
		<br>
		This would be kind of hard to imagine with the amount of questions people already have concerning magnetic levitation being that it is a rare implementation that has been around since the late 1960's in Japan and only seen in America later on and now implemented as a hyperloop by Elon Musk. Quantum Maglev has more dynamic mobility as two interdependant superconductive materials can now send signals through to the other interconnected superconductive material on a encrypted network. Allowing maglev interconnections on a blockchain network which is powered by an even greater maglev network keeps the maglev connection is established with always on power of liquid nitrogen.
		<br>
		If you are now thinking that sounds way to technical for me to understand. Scientists are working every day to make it safer and more effecient, which is pretty hard. So far, maglev has reported 0 casualties when people remain inside a moving compartment (this happened at Disney World with a monorail type maglev system, and nobody talks about it anymore for obvious reasons). Also, superconductive energy is easier to shield from electromagnetic frequencies (or radioactive frequencies as with nuclear power) because simple thermal mylar or aluminum sheets block 98% of all EMFs (which is far more than certain companies offer from their cell towers of mass destruction).
		<br>
		This will allow anybody who has a liquid nitrogen generator and the dewars to contain the LN to create a superconductive area suspended and interconnected to any superconductive material which has the same LN2 or other low-temperature superconductive area, and keep it stationary in a flux pinned state. You can think of strength flux-pinning as the magnetic flux between a magnetic door at a convienance store. You may have seen people try to force a magnetic door like this open while it was locked. This same strength when sent at a rapid succesion. Most magnetic doors have electricity applied coming from somewhere inside the frame of the door connected to a power switch of some kind. Now imagine the same power of both the door and the frame, but now you can polorize the door and the frame magnetic signal, and if the signal was strong enough you could open and close the door with the flip of a switch. This would never happen to electic doors because of safty reasons, but if that same strength is applied to superconductive materials and allows the safe mobility of you home and all your belongings to a safer area (i.e. a hurricane) you could not have to worry about what the highways may be like if you had to move out of the way really quickly.
		<br>
		Even still, when applying the same maglev system to a quantum field every connected surface becomes even stronger because of the quantum magnetic flux happening at a greater scale.
